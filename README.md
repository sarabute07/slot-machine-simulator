# slot-machine-simulator


This is a simple **slot machine game built in Python**.  
It runs directly in the terminal and lets you:

Deposit money into your balance  
Choose the number of lines to bet on (1â€“3)  
Place bets on each line  
Spin reels with random symbols  
Check winnings automatically  
Keep playing until you quit or run out of balance  

The project is beginner-friendly and focuses on Python basics such as loops, functions, input validation, and the `random` module.
